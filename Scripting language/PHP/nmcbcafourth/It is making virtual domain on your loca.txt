It is making virtual domain on your local host ;
i.e : nmcbcafourth.local or nmcbcafourth.loc or .local

Note : *.dev is reserved by google

Requirements to create virtual domain to use on a virtual host/server on your machine :

#STEP 1 - setup VirtualHost (PascalCase) from the file of host:
    i.e : (Host platform : Appache, IIS etc)
    -File path inside Appache to configure virtual host:
        => "D:\Xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf"
        or
        => "D:\Xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf" (it leads to httpd-vhosts.conf from extra folder)
    -Now, block of code to setup Virtual Host (Domain) inside appache:
        <VirtualHost nmcbcafourth.loc.80>
            DocumentRoot "D:\Xampp\htdocs\nmcbcafourth"
            ServerName nmcbcafourth.loc
            <Directory "D:\Xampp\htdocs\nmcbcafourth">
                Require all granted
            </Directory>
        </VirtualHost>

#STEP 2 ; Configure virtual domain and Host relation (like : DNS setup)
    Note : DNS enables to link english domain name and Host IP number

    - "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" file to access and setup virtual domain and host which gives your virtual hosting environment
    - But the host file from window folder will be restricted to edit.
    - Let's allow the security of host file to everyone inside a machine:
        - Right click on hosts file > properties > security tab.
        - Edit button >add >(Type: e) and click on "Check name" button which gives everyone user
        - Ok > Full control allow tick > Ok

        if the edit button step won't work 
        - Advanced button > owner > change > (Type: e ) and "Check name"
        - Everyone > ok > Ok
        -Then again go to property of hosts file and edit.

    - Now alllowing access to everyone of hosts file:
    -Open hosts file with notepad
    -Then, configure virtual domain and host there
        i.e 127.0.0.1 nmcbcafourth.loc

        where 127.0.0.1 is reserved IP address of local Host of Personal machine (computer).

#STEP 3 ; Now, once stop and start the appache sever from XAMPP control pannel 
#STEP 4 ; Go to your favourite browser > Type your virtual domain to acess from localhost (virtualhost): i.e : nmcbcafourth.loc/ (add trailing slash /)
